With this plugin, you can use `::include{file=./included.md}` statements to compose markdown files together.

Relative images and links in the imported files will have their paths rewritten to be relative the original document rather than the imported file.

An imported markdown file will "inherit" the heading levels. If the `::include{file=./included.md}` statement happens under Heading 2, for example, any heading 1 in the included file will be "translated" to have header level 3.
