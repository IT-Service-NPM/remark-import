[remarkInclude(this)](./remark-include.remarkinclude.md)


</td><td>

Async Remark plugin fabric function.

With this plugin, you can use `::include{file=./included.md}` statements to compose markdown files together.

This plugin is a modern fork of [remark-import](https://github.com/BrekiTomasson/remark-import) and [remark-include](https://github.com/Qard/remark-include)<!-- -->, compatible with Remark v15.

Relative images and links in the imported files will have their paths rewritten to be relative the original document rather than the imported file.

An imported markdown file will "inherit" the heading levels. If the `::include{file=./included.md}` statement happens under Heading 2, for example, any heading 1 in the included file will be "translated" to have header level 3.
